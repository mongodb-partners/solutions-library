Ultimate Rewards+ Credit Card","temp":null},{"text":"The Freedom Rewards Credit Card offers a range of benefits, including earning bonus points on select merchants (capped at $22 monthly) and EMI spends (also capped at $22 monthly). For other purchases, cardholders earn 1 point for every $13 spent. The card features a low interest rate for the first 90 days on non-EMI spends, excluding certain transactions. Cardholders enjoy discounts at partner restaurants and zero lost card liability. They also benefit from an interest-free credit period of up to 50 days and revolving credit at a nominal interest rate. The card offers a fuel surcharge waiver, welcome and renewal benefits, and contactless payment capability. Points can be redeemed for statement balance, travel benefits, and rewards from the Rewards Portal (1 point = $0.013). However, starting from January 1, 2023, there will be caps on reward point redemption for flights, hotel bookings, and cashback. Points are valid for two years from the transaction date. Eligibility includes being a salaried or self-employed individual within certain age and income limits. The membership fee is $45 plus taxes, but it can be waived off with annual spending of $450.

Rewards Plus Card","temp":null},{"text":"The All-in-One Rewards Card provides a range of benefits in two categories: Category A (Travel, Fuel, Groceries, Bill Payment, and Mobile Recharges) and Category B (Payment Platforms). In Category A, cardholders earn 5% monthly cashback on travel bookings through online portals, fuel expenses, groceries, bill payments, and mobile recharges. In Category B, cardholders receive 5% monthly cashback on spends on payment platforms. The maximum cashback per month for both categories is $12.50. However, recharges at outlets selling mobile accessories or bundled with mobile purchases are excluded from the cashback offer. Wallet loading is also ineligible for cashback. If spends overlap between categories, the customer will receive credit only under one feature. Rewards points are earned based on the merchant category code (MCC) captured for the transaction, and only specific MCCs recognized by Partner Networks will accrue 5% reward points. Rent payments and government-related transactions do not earn reward points. The card features EMV Chip Card technology for security and protection against unauthorized use. Cardholders enjoy up to 50 interest-free days from the date of purchase and revolving credit at a nominal interest rate. By using the card, customers can save up to $300 annually. The card also offers a 1% fuel surcharge waiver. Reward points earned can be redeemed as cashback against the statement balance, with a monthly redemption cap of 3,000 reward points. Cardmembers can also redeem up to 70% of the product\/voucher value through reward points on select vouchers\/products and pay the remaining amount via credit card. Eligibility criteria for the card vary for salaried and self-employed individuals. The joining\/renewal membership fee is $42 plus applicable taxes. Goods and Services Tax (GST) is applicable on fees and charges, and the applicable GST rate depends on the place of provision and supply.
