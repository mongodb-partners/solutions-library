- **Expected Outcome** - What should happen
- **Actual Results Table:**
  - Transaction ID
  - Decision (approve/escalate/reject)
  - Confidence Score
  - Risk Score
- **Success Indicators** - Green checkmarks for passed tests

### 6. Human Review Queue

![Human Review Queue](images/ui-human-review-queue.png)

**Queue Overview:**
- **Pending Reviews** - Number of transactions awaiting review
- **In Progress** - Currently being reviewed
- **Urgent** - High-priority transactions
- **High Priority** - Transactions requiring immediate attention

**Transaction List:**
- Shows all transactions requiring human review
- Sorted by priority (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Click on any transaction to review details

### 7. Human Review Interface

![Human Review Detail](images/ui-human-review-detail.png)

**Review Components:**

**Transaction Details (Left Panel):**
- Transaction type and amount
- Sender and recipient information
- Current status
- Transaction metadata

**AI Recommendation (Right Panel):**
- AI decision and confidence level
- Detailed reasoning explanation
- Risk factors identified
- Suspicious patterns detected

**Your Decision (Bottom):**
- **Approve** - Override AI and approve transaction
- **Reject** - Confirm rejection
- **Hold for Investigation** - Escalate for further review
- **Review Notes** - Add comments for audit trail

**How to Review:**
1. Read transaction details carefully
2. Review AI analysis and risk factors
3. Make your decision based on combined information
4. Add notes explaining your decision
5. Click the appropriate action button

## Demo Walkthrough

### Step 1: Launch Test Scenario

1. In the left sidebar, select "Fraud Ring Detection" from dropdown
2. Click "Run Scenario" button
3. Watch as 3 transactions are submitted automatically

### Step 2: Monitor Processing

1. Click on "Active Workflows" tab
2. See the three workflows processing in real-time
3. Notice status changes as workflows progress

### Step 3: View Results

1. Navigate to "Scenario Results" tab
2. See all three transactions marked as "escalate"
3. Verify confidence scores are around 65%

### Step 4: Human Review

1. Go to "Human Review" tab
2. See 3 transactions in the queue
3. Click on the first transaction (TXN_20250918_45D7CFEF)

## Troubleshooting UI Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Dashboard not loading | Check Streamlit is running on port 8505 |
| No workflows showing | Verify Temporal worker is running |
| Scenarios not working | Check API server is running on port 8000 |
| Data not refreshing | Click "Refresh" button or wait 30 seconds |
| Human review not updating | Ensure MongoDB connection is active |

## Advanced Features

### Custom Transaction Submission

While not shown in UI, you can submit custom transactions via API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/transactions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "transaction_id": "CUSTOM-001",
    "amount": 10000,
    "currency": "USD",
    "type": "wire_transfer",
    "source_account": "ACC-001",
    "destination_account": "ACC-002",
    "description": "Custom test transaction"
  }'
```

Then monitor it through the dashboard.
